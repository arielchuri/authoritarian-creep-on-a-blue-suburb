# Futures Methodology Framework: Montclair Under Authoritarianism

## Project Overview
**Research Question**: How will the residents of Montclair, NJ experience and adapt to a gradual national shift toward authoritarianism over the next 6-10 years?

**Core Challenge**: Understanding how macro-political changes cascade through local communities, affecting different demographic groups in varied ways, and exploring potential community responses and adaptations.

## Methodology Selection and Sequencing

### Phase 1: Foundation Building - **Three Horizons Framework**

**What**: Map the transition from current democratic norms (Horizon 1) through the turbulent period of democratic erosion (Horizon 2) to potential authoritarian consolidation (Horizon 3).

**How**: 
- Horizon 1 (Present/Declining): Current democratic institutions, civil liberties, community norms in Montclair
- Horizon 2 (Transition/Innovation): Emerging authoritarian practices, community resistance efforts, adaptive strategies
- Horizon 3 (Future/Emerging): Consolidated authoritarian state and transformed community life

**Why**: This framework provides essential temporal structure for understanding how change unfolds over time, helping to identify key transition points and emerging patterns. It's particularly useful for authoritarian transitions because it acknowledges that change happens gradually, not suddenly.

**When in Project**: Early phase, after initial signal scanning but before detailed scenario development. This creates the temporal scaffolding for all subsequent analysis.

**Outputs**: Timeline of democratic erosion, identification of key transition periods, mapping of declining vs. emerging systems

### Phase 2: Deep Structural Analysis - **Causal Layered Analysis (CLA)**

**What**: Examine the authoritarian shift across four levels: Litany (surface events), Systems (underlying structures), Worldview (ideological frameworks), and Myth/Metaphor (deep cultural narratives).

**How**:
- **Litany**: Specific policy changes, election results, protest events, local government actions
- **Systems**: Democratic institutions, media landscape, economic structures, social networks
- **Worldview**: Competing ideologies (democracy vs. authoritarianism), political philosophies, community values
- **Myth/Metaphor**: American Dream, democratic participation, community identity, national narratives

**Why**: CLA reveals how surface political events connect to deeper cultural and structural forces. For authoritarianism, this is crucial because it operates simultaneously through policy changes, institutional capture, ideological shifts, and cultural transformation.

**When in Project**: Mid-early phase, after Three Horizons establishes temporal framework but before scenario planning begins. This provides the analytical depth needed for rich scenario development.

**Outputs**: Multi-layered understanding of change drivers, identification of intervention points, recognition of deep cultural forces at play

### Phase 3: Multiple Futures Exploration - **Scenario Planning**

**What**: Develop 3-4 detailed scenarios showing different pathways for how authoritarianism might evolve and how Montclair residents might respond.

**How**:
- **Scenario A**: "Boiling Frog" - Gradual erosion with limited resistance
- **Scenario B**: "Sanctuary City" - Active local resistance and mutual aid networks
- **Scenario C**: "Divided Community" - Internal conflict and fragmentation
- **Scenario D**: "Exodus and Accommodation" - Mass departure and remaining population adaptation

Each scenario integrates STEEP analysis with detailed resident profiles (your AI-generated personas).

**Why**: Scenario planning prevents single-future thinking and helps explore how different variables might interact. Given the uncertainty around authoritarian transitions, multiple scenarios help stakeholders prepare for various possibilities rather than assuming one inevitable outcome.

**When in Project**: Core phase, after foundational analysis (Three Horizons, CLA) provides understanding of change dynamics. This is the heart of the analysis where your detailed resident profiles and STEEP analysis come together.

**Outputs**: Rich narrative scenarios, exploration of different adaptation strategies, identification of critical uncertainties and decision points

### Phase 4: Impact Assessment and Intervention - **Future Wheel**

**What**: Map the cascading impacts of key authoritarian policies or events on different aspects of Montclair community life, using your resident profiles as test cases.

**How**:
- **Central Change**: Specific authoritarian policy (e.g., "Federal funding cuts to sanctuary jurisdictions")
- **Primary Impacts**: Direct effects on local government, schools, services
- **Secondary Impacts**: How primary impacts affect different resident demographics
- **Tertiary Impacts**: Long-term community transformation and adaptation

Create separate Future Wheels for different resident profiles (upper-middle-class progressive, lower-middle-class independent, etc.).

**Why**: Future Wheel helps visualize how single changes create cascading effects throughout complex systems. For your project, this connects macro-political changes to micro-level impacts on specific residents, making abstract authoritarianism concrete and personal.

**When in Project**: Later phase, after scenarios are developed. This tests how specific changes from your scenarios would actually affect your detailed resident profiles.

**Outputs**: Visual impact maps, identification of unexpected consequences, understanding of how different demographics experience the same changes differently

## Integration Strategy

### How Methodologies Connect:
1. **Three Horizons** establishes temporal framework and transition dynamics
2. **CLA** provides analytical depth about change drivers across multiple levels
3. **Scenario Planning** explores alternative pathways using insights from previous phases
4. **Future Wheel** tests specific impacts on detailed resident profiles

### Why This Sequence Works:
- **Broad to Specific**: Moves from general temporal patterns to specific impact analysis
- **Abstract to Concrete**: Progresses from theoretical frameworks to detailed resident experiences
- **Exploratory to Evaluative**: Begins with open exploration, then tests specific impacts
- **Individual to Systemic**: Examines both personal experiences and community-wide changes

## Stakeholder Engagement Integration

### Early Engagement (Three Horizons/CLA):
- **Community workshops** to validate historical patterns and identify emerging signals
- **Expert interviews** with political scientists, historians, and community leaders
- **Focus groups** with different demographic segments to understand worldviews and concerns

### Mid-Project Engagement (Scenario Planning):
- **Scenario validation sessions** with community stakeholders
- **Role-playing exercises** where participants inhabit different scenarios
- **Cross-demographic dialogue** bringing together different resident profiles

### Late Engagement (Future Wheel):
- **Impact assessment workshops** testing specific policy changes
- **Resilience planning sessions** identifying community adaptation strategies
- **Action planning** based on insights from all previous phases

## Speculative Artifact Connection

Your idea of a **local newspaper** aligns perfectly with this methodology framework:

- **Three Horizons**: Newspaper editions from different time periods showing transition
- **CLA**: Articles addressing different analytical levels (news, analysis, opinion, cultural pieces)
- **Scenario Planning**: Multiple newspaper versions showing different futures
- **Future Wheel**: Special editions focusing on specific policy impacts

The **loyalty test role-play** could serve as a stakeholder engagement tool, particularly effective after participants have read the speculative newspapers and understand the different scenarios.

## Expected Outcomes

This methodology framework will produce:
- **Temporal Understanding**: How authoritarian transitions unfold over time
- **Structural Insights**: Deep analysis of change drivers and resistance points
- **Multiple Pathways**: Various scenarios for community adaptation
- **Specific Impacts**: Detailed understanding of how different residents experience change
- **Actionable Intelligence**: Insights for community resilience and resistance planning

The combination of rigorous futures methodologies with your detailed resident profiles creates a powerful framework for understanding how macro-political changes affect real people in specific places.
