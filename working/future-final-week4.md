# Futures Final Project

---

## Context

The residents of Montclair, NJ under a gradual, national shift to an authoritarian government.

Following a world-wide trend towards authoritarianism and documentation of a variety of organizations planning and executing their an attempt to increase the power of the executive branch while decreasing the capabilities of the federal government.

I hope to explore the effects of these changes on the local community and their different demographic groups. I also hope to explore potential community responses to these forces.

---

## Signal Scanning

So called 'thought balloons' (expressed intentions or desires of an organization or group that are easily denied later and are used to gauge possible wider public acceptance)

---

## Foundation Building - **Three Horizons**

I will create an overview of the transition from current norms to emerging authoritarian practices and then a consolidated authoritarian state.

This will provide a temporal framework and highlight key points of transition.

---

## Time Horizon Selection

6 to 10 years.

---

## **Causal Layered Analysis**

This exercise will examine the authoritarian shift across four levels.

1. Surface events: Policy changes, election results, protest events
2. Systems and underlying structures: Institutions, media landscape, economic structures, social networks
3. Ideologies: political philosophy, community values, ethics
4. Myths: Community identity, the American dream

## Day in the life

I plan to use AI for creating several fictitious residents of Montclair.
Using AI provides more details without my personal preconceptions and is based on its own secondary research.
Below is list of data points created by Claude.ai, Claude Sonnet 4.
The demographic and marketing details about the fictional residents allows us to envision multiple avenues to be effected by the forces determined by the _STEEP_/_Driver's of Change_ exercises.

Claude.ai example prompt:

_Create demographic data about a fictional, upper-middle class resident of Montclair, nj. Something that a political analyst, marketer, or advertiser might use to make decisions. and then provide a 'day in the life' scenario of this person_

## Multiple Futures Exploration **Scenario Planning**

3-4 Detailed descriptions of different ways the effects of authoritarianism may develop and be responded to in the community.

## Speculative Artifact

The form a discursive object or experience could take is heavily dependent on the previous exercises.
One could imagine a version of the local paper along with a guided conversation with stakeholders.
A local news paper has the advantage of being able to address a wide variety of subjects for the stakeholder conversation.

---

## Stakeholder Engagement Design

The reading of the local paper could be accompanied by a guided conversation.
I could also see some kind of _loyalty test_ role-play after reading the newspaper.
