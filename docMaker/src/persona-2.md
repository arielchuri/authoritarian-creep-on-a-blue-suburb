Mike loads his tools into his Ford F-150, checking that he has everything needed for today's conduit installation. He grabs his hard hat, safety vest, and lunch Jennifer packed the night before.

On the drive home, Mike calls his father to check in and discuss plans for watching the Yankees game together this weekend.
