<h3>Day in the Life: Michael &ldquo;Mike&rdquo; O&rsquo;Sullivan</h3>
<h4>5:30 AM - Early Start</h4>
<p>Mike&rsquo;s phone alarm goes off in his Lower Montclair ranch home. He immediately checks his work phone for any messages from his foreman about today&rsquo;s job site location. Today he&rsquo;s working on a commercial electrical installation in Newark. He quietly gets ready, trying not to wake his wife Jennifer or the kids.</p>
<h4>6:00 AM - Morning Routine</h4>
<p>In the kitchen, Mike starts his Mr. Coffee machine and makes two cups - one for now, one for his thermos. He checks Facebook on his phone while the coffee brews, scrolling through updates from high school friends and union colleagues. He sees a post from his Local 102 about upcoming contract negotiations that he&rsquo;ll need to discuss with the guys today.</p>
<h4>6:15 AM - Work Preparation</h4>
<p>Mike loads his tools into his Ford F-150, checking that he has everything needed for today&rsquo;s conduit installation. He grabs his hard hat, safety vest, and lunch Jennifer packed the night before. He starts the truck and listens to NJ 101.5 for traffic updates and local news while the engine warms up.</p>
<h4>6:45 AM - Commute</h4>
<p>The drive to Newark takes 35 minutes in morning traffic. Mike listens to the Dennis and Judi show on NJ 101.5, occasionally switching to ESPN Radio for sports updates.

He responds to a text from his neighbor about organizing the annual block party.</p>
<h4>12:00 PM - Lunch Break</h4>

<h4>2:30 PM - Afternoon Work</h4>

<h4>4:00 PM - End of Workday</h4>
<p>Mike cleans up his tools and completes his timesheet. He discusses tomorrow&rsquo;s work plan with the foreman and confirms his availability for Saturday overtime. The extra money would help with Emma&rsquo;s dance class expenses and building up the family&rsquo;s emergency fund.</p>
<h4>4:45 PM - Commute Home</h4>
<p>On the drive home, Mike calls his father to check in and discuss plans for watching the Yankees game together this weekend.

<h4>5:30 PM - Family Time</h4>
<p>At home, Mike changes out of his work clothes and helps Danny with his math homework while Jennifer finishes dinner.

<h4>7:00 PM - Community Engagement</h4>

<h4>10:15 PM - Wind Down</h4>
